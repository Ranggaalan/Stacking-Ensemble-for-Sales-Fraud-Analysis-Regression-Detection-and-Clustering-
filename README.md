## Project Description
This project implements **Stacking Ensemble Learning** for **sales forecasting and fraud detection** using a multi-model approach. The project consists of three main aspects:
1. **Forecasting**: Predicting fertilizer sales using regression techniques.
2. **Classification**: Detecting credit card fraud using classification techniques.
3. **Clustering**: Segmenting customers based on transactions.

## Dataset
The dataset includes **1,000 sales records** and credit card transaction data for fraud detection. The models were developed using various machine learning algorithms and compared to determine the best performance.

## Methodology
### 1. **Sales Prediction** (Regression)
The stacking regression model consists of the following algorithms:
1. Ridge Regression  
2. Lasso Regression  
3. Polynomial Regression  
4. Decision Tree Regressor  
5. Random Forest Regressor  
6. Gradient Boosting Regressor  
7. XGBoost Regressor  

**Results:**
The stacking model with **3 best features** achieved an **RÂ² = 0.8243**, outperforming individual models.

### 2. **Fraud Detection** (Classification)
The stacking classification model uses the following algorithms:
1. Random Forest  
2. Gradient Boosting Classifier  
3. XGBClassifier  
4. KNeighborsClassifier  
5. DecisionTreeClassifier  

**Results:**
The stacking model achieved **97.92% accuracy**, surpassing individual models.

### 3. **Customer Segmentation** (Clustering)
Clustering was used to divide customers into **3 clusters**:
- **Cluster 1** has the highest number of transactions.
- **The highest average transaction amount for customers** is in clusters **1, 0, and 2**.
- **The highest average transaction amount for merchants** is in clusters **2, 0, and 1**.

#### Cluster Characteristics:
- **Yellow Cluster**: Largest customer group with diverse transactions, distributed across various locations.
- **Purple Cluster**: Local customers with small but frequent transactions, mostly within a specific area.
- **Green Cluster**: High purchasing power customers, making larger but less frequent transactions.

Most customers belong to **the Yellow Cluster**, indicating a broad business reach across regional and national locations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, Numpy
- **Machine Learning**: Stacking Ensemble for regression and classification
- **Clustering**: K-Means for customer segmentation
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
